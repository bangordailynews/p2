##Description
This is a simple, 1 page xkcd password generator created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, AJAX, and JSON. It accepts 4 to 10 words and allows user to input any natural number as a maximum length. However, the web-app will let you know that your choice of max password length and number of words doesn't make sense. The web-app will also check if your input is a natural number or not. It will insist to get a natural number if the input field is non-empty.

##Demo
Demo will be presented in a live section.
